As the hours tick by and we're supposed to be sleeping, some of us are restless with a bundle of nervous energy... Half feels like butterflies in our stomach, the other half, a hearty sukiyaki meal the day before 🤤😂

DAY ONE of our scooting adventures!
Fukuoka to Kitakyushu - 70kms / 1800kms
Estimated scooting time: 8 hours
Weather: Expected rains
Mood: Extremely nervous on our first day!
We finally made it to Kitakyushu in one piece after about 10 hours on the road and were greeted by the sight of a beautiful rainbow. Shortly after we hit the main town, it started pouring. We took cover in Macdonalds for about 2 hours when we finally decided to brave the rain and complete the last 15 kms to the hotel.... when... it started to hail! After more taking shelter, we got to our hotel at 12am.

Temperature was cooool. We started at 12 degrees c but one stage it dropped to 8. It was hard when we stopped scooting, for example to take a drink. Had to keep going.

Calories burnt: ~6000 kcal

We subsisted on convenience food the whole day and didnt manage to have time for a full meal. Whatevs we have enough fats on us to last 😂

By the time we went to bed it was 2am. So tmr will be a shorter day. Calves aching, feeling exhausted but otherwise doing okay!

DAY TWO of our scooting adventures!
Kitakyushu to Shimonoseki - 90kms / 1800kms
Estimated scooting time: 3 hours
Weather: 8 degrees c, expected rains
Mood: A little sore and tired but otherwise okay!
We woke up extremely exhausted, having gone to bed at 2am last night because we were waiting out the rain and hailstorm. Surprisingly, our bodies held up fine, not too much tiredness today either.

We decided to take it easy today, and spend time repacking and readjusting our pack. Today we officially crossed from the island of Kyushu into Honshu!!!! So begins the main leg of our journey in this curious and fabulous country!

70kms tomorrow!

DAY THREE of our scooting adventures!
Shimonoseki to Hofu - 165km / 1800km
Estimated scooting time: 10 hours
Weather: 12 degrees c, glorious weather
Mood: Had a hearty breakfast at Starbucks and a wonderful send off by the staff there!
We started off with a wonderful sendoff from the staff at Starbucks! Our tummies full of nourishment and caffeine, we set off along the coast to a beautiful seaside scenery. The weather was glorious!

This 75km stretch is the beginning of a steep ascent into the mountains. We made awesome time in the first half only to slow down, lol. About 50kms in, we got hopelessly lost and were so tired Michelle fell asleep beside the cemetary. We also navigated the treacherous mountain passes that had nary a sidewalk and many oncoming trucks. Felt like our lives flashed before our eyes twice today.

Today's trip can't be completed without talking about the two wonderful groups of people we met along the way. We get a lot of people asking us what we're doing and where we're going. Curious stares are common. Sometimes we come across special people who are genuinely interested in sharing our dream. In their small ways, they show their support with a thoughtful gift here, encouraging words there and warm smiles everywhere.

This time we had two special send offs in one day - the group at Starbucks in Shimonoseki and another at the 7-11 in Asa! With their words, "ganbatte", trailing behind us, we headed further into the mountains with our trusty scooters!

Total distance travelled: 75km

Total time including stops: 12 hours

Day four - A lesson in humility

DAY FOUR of our scooting adventures

Hofu to Hiroshima - 274 / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 9 hours

Weather: Didn’t take note!

Mood: A little nervous after the close escape

We set off into the chilly morning with a tired and aching body to head up into the mountain passes of Hofu. It wasn't long into the morning that Michelle's breaks were busted. Cruising down one of the gentle slopes, she couldn't break properly and had to slide to a stop, throwing herself off the scooter. All the flipping and parkour training we did paid off because she landed safely on her feet!

There was a moment of alarmingly fear, when the reality that the fall could have happened down a mountain pass, but also a sigh of blessing to know that nothing serious actually happened. With sombre thoughts, we decided to walk down to the nearest station and take the train to Hiroshima instead of pushing through or walking.

A lesson in humility. We set off from Fukuoka with brash confidence, boldness enveloping our every step, certainty that our bodies can hold up to the gruelling task and our goals easily met. Having what we'd refer to as a tiny setback, has become a stark reminder that perhaps, arrogance is only for the fool-hearted and that to truly succeed in a great challenge, requires both humility and confidence.

Thanking the mountain gods for a lesson learnt!
