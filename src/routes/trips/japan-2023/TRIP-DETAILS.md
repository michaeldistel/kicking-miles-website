Day 1 – Back on the Road

Tokyo to Oyama
16 October 2023
57.2 km, 6h 30m

We started from a small business hotel on the edge of Tokyo, packs strapped down and scooters ready. It was early, the streets still quiet, though the sun was already sharp against the buildings.

We dragged ourselves out of bed, excited and ready for the day ahead. It felt good to be back on the scooters again. Just free, moving across the countryside one kick at a time.

It was nice starting the day with Alex. His passion and excitement carried through everything. The way he spoke about the road ahead, the places we might pass, even the small details lifted the mood straight away.

The air was cooler than the day before, and the first kilometres slipped by easily. Suburban streets soon turned into open stretches of farmland. Back in rhythm, steady kicks, quiet roads, short pauses to drink or just look around.

We stopped often. A wall in the sun, a quick photo, or a longer break inside 7-Eleven where Alex nearly drifted off over his snack.

Later we joined Route 4. Something very familiar for me. I had spent time in 2017 kicking along this road, and coming back felt like meeting an old friend I had not seen for years. The trucks roared past and the blue signs pointed towards Utsunomiya, but I felt strangely at home on that stretch.

By the time we reached Oyama the kilometres had added up. Fifty-seven in total, six and a half hours moving, 2,349 calories burnt according to the watch.

Dinner was at Orion Gyoza near Oyama Station. A lively, bright spot, gyoza and beer filling the gap the numbers had left.

It felt good to complete the first day. A part of me felt relief that my body and soul had not forgotten the scooter, the feel of the road, and Japan itself. I have spent so much time here over the years, and finishing the day reminded me why. Japan is a place I truly love and miss.

Day 2 – Endurance and Small Wins

Oyama to Yaita
17 October 2023
64.0 km, 8h 32m

Day two was not about freshness or excitement. It was about grind. Eight and a half hours of steady kicking, sixty-four kilometres in total, and the hills beginning to rise.

We found places to stop where we could. A patch of shade outside a shop, bottles lined up at our feet, silence between us while we caught our breath.

The road gave us one clear marker. A small Route 4 sign, nothing special, just a number: 100 km to Tokyo. We stood there for a photo, smiling because it meant something. For me, Route 4 carries memories from 2017, when I spent days moving along it. Coming back felt like reconnecting with an old part of myself.

The rest of the day blurred into repetition. Kick, roll, pause. Trucks passing, towns slipping by. No drama, just the slow work of distance.

By the time we reached Yaita, the tiredness was heavy. Hotel Route Inn gave us a place to stop, nothing more needed. Dinner was curry rice with hamburger steak, miso soup, a salad, and cold Asahi. Ordinary food, but it landed perfectly.

This is the beauty of Japan. There is always somewhere to get a drink or some food. The roads are always clean and nice.

Day 3 – Into the Mountains

Yaita to Nasu
18 October 2023
4h 30m

The last day. The distance was short, but the road tilted up as we left Yaita behind. This was the climb, the one that had been waiting. Each push felt slower, the gradient asking for more, but the mountains ahead pulled us on.

The destination was not just another hotel. Épinard Nasu sat in the hills, tucked into the green. Reaching it meant arriving in the mountains, not just finishing a route. The views opened as we gained height, valleys stretching below and ridges stacked against the horizon.

This trip had a purpose. To be at Gordon’s
wedding. Not just any friend, but someone from the Japan 2017 trip
. Rolling into Nasu by scooter tied the two journeys together, six years apart but connected by the same simple way of moving.

By afternoon we checked into Épinard Nasu. The room looked out to trees turning with the season, a quiet space after the climb.

The next day we stood among friends and family in the woods, watching Gordon and his bride in the centre. To arrive there by scooter felt improbable and exactly right.
