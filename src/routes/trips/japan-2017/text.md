DAY 15 of our scooting adventures!

Iga to Yokkaichi - 714km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 0 hours

Weather: 16 degrees c

Mood: Two of our team mates are down with food poisoning and diarrhoea. We're taking it easy and hopping on a train to the next town.

When in Iga do as the ninjas do! It was an unexpected stop over and an even more unexpected city fare! When we were about to leave Iga, we found out that there was a ninja festival of sorts!

Having decided to take the train to Yokkaichi because both the boys were down with food poisoning and diarrhoea, we took a detour and joined the local throng at the Iga castle. It was a pleasant surprise to see the whole town out in the field; many lovers having a picnic under the blooming sakura trees, families going for the ninja performances at the museum and even the shiba-ken dogs dressing as ninjas and posing for the crowds!

We learnt that aside from political espionage and being body guards of the lords, they were also secret messenger carriers who protected important information with their lives. Highly sensitive documents were to be committed to memory and even carved on their skin if needed.

At that moment it occurred to us that here we are easily communicating with each other over technology - Whatsapp, email, social media platforms - while it took them the risk of a human life for a simple message. Life has changed over the centuries and for better. We might be commoners but the commoners of today live a better life than than the kings and lords of yesterday.

Puts our modern advancement in perspective.

Day 16 - Simple appreciation, simple joys
10 Apr

DAY 16 of our scooting adventures!

Yokkaichi to Nagoya - 754km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 8 hours

Weather: 13 degrees c

Mood: The boys are still slightly unwell, so we took it easy today.

We had a very friendly send off by the hotel staff! The boys were still down with mild diarrhoea so we took it easy and went at a slow pace to Nagoya today. The elevation was in our favour and the grey weather held!

During lunch at Sukiya, a type of beef bowl, and also for the last two days, the girls were ordering twice as much as the boys. It was funny because almost all the waitresses wanted to serve the bigger orders to the boys before we tell them its ours,

One of the things that we have come to appreciate this trip are the convenience stores along the way. These common, unremarkable shops have supported us in more ways than one. They serve as a rest stop for replenishment and refuelling, they allow us a place to rest and use the washroom and they are also a distance marker that when passed, tells us that we have moved forwards from our last spot.

Without them, our trip would be twice as gruelling and three times more difficult to complete. Perhaps, these common and apparently insignificant things, serve society in more ways than they are given credit for. Many things we take for granted are simply because they are just there. And in taking things for granted, perhaps we lose sight of the small ways that we can live happily. Expectation is always the nemesis to joy.

Perhaps a simple appreciation is all that is required to spark joy in our daily life.

DAY 18 of our scooting adventures!

Nagoya to Gamagori - 817km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 10 hours

Weather: 16 degrees c

Mood: Bright and sunny, just like the weather today!

We left Nagoya in sunny spirits today. The weather was a perfect 18 degrees c and the sun was glorious! Today was a day of stopping for repairs.

Halfway in we had to stop for repairs. Michael's bolts came lose barely after 10kms. 45 mins later, some handiwork and hyper restlessness, we were off again!

On the way we an inviting cafe and hopped in for lunch. Turns out it was a cafe for girls, everything thoughtfully setup, music at the right noise level, lights not too glaring etc... the toilets even had pretty paper and sanitary napkins These people know their target audience.

We headed off again only to have the bolts come loose. For the second time today, we stopped beside another convenience store "combini" to repair our scooters. When we are on the roads and there is no obvious solution visible for miles, we have to become creative and make do with what we have. Out comes Oral B dental floss in place of plumbing tape. (For those who don't know, plumbing tape is wound around the screw thread of pipes so it seals better.)

Another 35 minutes later, we were off again... this time we made it all the way to Gamagori!!!

Day 19 - 7-eleven is not just for refuelling!
13 Apr

DAY 19 of our scooting adventures!

Gamagori to Hammamatsu - 872km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 10 hours

Weather: 19 degrees c

Mood: A little tired from our 100 year old haunted hotel last night but overall 'genki' and happy!

Stopping by 7-11 to takeaway our dinner just before we hit our hotel, we spent a couple of minutes resting and catching our breath. We were chatting abt last night's haunted hotel when Gordon told us abt his dream of dementors and sleep paralysis (where reality and dreams combine). At the point when Yoneko san walked out, Tresha and Michelle were laughing at having sleep paralysis filled with yakiniku bbq and cream buns.

Our laughter caught her attention and she beamed us a smile and said that laughter and happiness is the best thing in life. She had a purposeful step and a happy aura about her. In a country where outward expressions of feelings are seldom voiced, this honest sharing of thoughts caught our attention. I immediately lapsed into my broken Japanese. We made some small talk about our scooting adventure and her trip to Singapore 50 years ago when she was in her 20s. Out came her recounting of the happy memories she had of her travels. I could almost see the glow of her smile in the dark. She spoke about visiting the bird park even though she was petrified of birds, lol, and remembered Bugis village and the gay scene.

The vividness with which she recounted her memories was crisp and her passion warm, as if it happened yesterday. I felt transported back into the Singapore of the 60s as I walked along the dark streets of the Hamamatsu town in Japan at 8pm. There's something about listening to older people recount their stories, it is almost always bursting with feelings... feelings of their memories. You know how time somehow cleanses our experiences of the baggage of emotions and leaves the memory somehow simpler and purer, perhaps even more true to what was present? That was the sense of simplicity and pureness I felt when I listened to Yoneko san recount her stories.

She invited us into her cafe, which she does as a hobby, for free coffee. We sat and listened with the wonder and curiosity that young children have when listening to their heroine's exploits. As she spoke, she interspersed her recounting with, "nan te iu no", meaning, "what's that called..." and alot of animated hand movements.

Watching her chat while making coffee for us brought to mind a passionate, energetic woman in her younger years, keen to explore the world, with so much curiosity, openness and love. I wondered what her life has been like, and I wondered about the thoughts and feelings that go through her mind today. What beautiful and ugly, happy but sad, loving but painful experiences did she have to make her who she is today? Did she fall in love and had her heart broken. Does she still think of her lover? What does she feel about her younger years travelling? Does she wish to travel now? So many questions to ask and so much desire to paint a clearer picture of this beautiful and happy 73 year old lady who lives in a random Japanese town.

I would have loved to spend a few more days getting to know Yoneko san, but we had to be on our way and she had an English class to attend. Yet for a moment, our paths crossed and a wonderful exchange happened that touched our hearts. A truly random meeting of souls at a cross junction.

We said our goodbyes with a promise to contact us if she ever comes to Singapore. Thank you for a beautiful moment Yoneko san

Day 20 - Our first serious casualty!

DAY 20 of our scooting adventures!

Hammamatsu to Shizuoka - 948km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 12 hours

Weather: 20 degrees c

Mood: Starting to feel exhausted again after 3 consecutive days of scooting.

After a fond farewell from the staff at our hotel, we made our way through Hamamatsu town. There's something about Hamamatsu... everyone was really spontaneous and friendly here for some reason! Aside from Yoneko san we met yesterday, we came across 3 more wonderful groups of people on the way out. During travels like these, we sometimes get horrible experiences but more often than not, the wonderful experiences outweigh the bad and Hamamatsu was a good example. We left in happy spirits!

About 3/4 of the way along, we went pass a jolly old man ushering children along the road, one of those school safety volunteers. He smiled and waved happily to each of us as we passed him and wished us safe travels or "kiotsukete" in a very earnest voice. At the next traffic light stop, we all spoke about how friendly but also how cautious he was and we attributed it to his age.

Who knew that soon after this, we'd have our very first serious casualty! Along one of the farm roads going downslope 90 degrees around the bend, we went one by one like gregarious racers, turning lower to the ground to take the corner sharply. 1st, 2nd, 3rd person passes and suddenly we heard a loud thud and crash. We immediately jammed our breaks, flipped out heads around and saw Tresha face plant into the asphalt road, her scooter flung away from her.

We threw our scooters off and sprinted to her rescue, no idea why we didn't scoot instead, and found her lying dazed on the ground. She managed to sit herself up in the time we got to her. All of us on this trip have had the luck to be privy to such an experience. I could see the look on her face, trying to process what had happened.

After some inspection, it turned out that she hit herself on the chin, rolled off to her right and landed face down. There were wounds in four spots, the deepest one being on her right hip. Her palms took the second brunt and she had deep asphalt chafing on the other spots.

After some first aid administration and intense squirming, we were eventually good to go again. We all made an executive decision to take the train to Shizuoka so she could rest her wounds. Tresha was saying, "if only I wore my tights higher, I would have less of a wound" and she was right.

But at the same time that's what an adventure is, a risk taken for a gain in spirit. The words, "if only", or "we should have", doesn't exist on an adventure because there is no space for them. Adventures breathe and flow along, happening in spilt second blocks, the concept of safety flashing by, the risk taken, a deep reminder of what we're sacrificing and the beautiful moments passing by, a wonderful reward for our sacrifice.

And the only way to really know if we are truly living life, is when you shed the cloak of safety to ride the wave of the bold, to go where we've never been to before. And that place is different for each and everyone of us.

In the end, everyday is simply another opportunity and a reminder to be brave and courageous. No more, no less.

DAY 21 of our scooting adventures!

Shizuoka to Mishima - 1006km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 5 hours

Weather: 20 degrees c

Mood: Exhausted but we have officially hit our 1000km mark!!!

As our scooters pulled into the town of Mishima this afternoon, we hi-fived each other for hitting our 1000km mark and then danced a little jig and had a little celebratory meal at Macdonalds! More than halfway!!! And it felt like it wasn't that many days ago when we started.

We are in overall relatively good physical, emotional and mental condition. Our feet are extremely sore with some water retention. My back hurts from trying to overcompensate for my tight quadriceps and I feel generally exhausted. The most tired muscle in my body must be my calves as I kick off from my tippy toes so I don't need to do as many semi-squats for a full heel strike.

Many people have asked about our strokes. I'd say I use my "quads + full heel strike" 50% of the time and "calves + toe strike" the remaining 50%. The quad combo requires us to use our whole body, including the back muscles to support us as we do a squat with each kick. It is the most economical movement for speed and is ideal when moving for long distances without stopping. The calves and toe combo is easier when navigating the streets. It is also great for short sprints, but it doesn't give as much power as the full heel strike combo.

My hands are also sore from gripping the handlebar, especially when going down bumpy surfaces. The padding on my Giro gloves help to absorb some of the shock but our bodies take most of it as the scooter is very stiff. Because the gloves are not fully-covered gloves, my fingers look like they are half dyed in henna ink from the sunburn, haha!

We lose alot of salts everyday from the vigorous sweating. Our black shirts look like there's a salt trail on them at the end of each day. It is fundamentally important that we consume electrolytes to replace them at regular intervals. I know when I don't have enough because a splitting headache will ensue.

Emotionally, I'm still feeling motivated to get to Hakodate. Aside from some mountain slopes and the initial horrible weather conditions, the journey had been pretty pleasant. My bag happens to be the heaviest as I somehow load unnecessary things like books, extra clothes, moisturiser etc, but that just means that I am indirectly conditioning my fitness over the 1800kms LOL.

Mentally, the terrain is starting to get dull, the people predictable and the scenery repetitive. I have a scooting playlist that I use throughout the day. Rihanna always starts the morning with her high energy songs. I do electro in the mid mornings, pop songs like Justin Bieber in the late afternoon and then I slow down with some slow crooning or even meditation music in the evening. I've never been a run-and-blast-music kinda person but on long haul scoots like this, some music does help.

Gordon and Michael were chatting about their "Beast mode" music when Tresha asked me what I had on. I looked at her and said, "Meditation for Deep Sleep" is playing right now, LOL! And somehow it really does work for me.

My relatively new Asics Noosa Tri shoes have almost worn down such that I lose traction when I kick off sandy surfaces. Aside from wear and tear, our scooters are holding up surprisingly well for the distances they have travelled.

Calories-wise, we loose about 1000kcal per 10km we do. This averages out the easy and difficult days and factors in the weight of our luggages. I'm starting to feel my metabolism rise after the second week. It also helps to drink three shots of caffeine throughout the day.

We've met so many people along the way, some excited and inspired, some happily cheering us but most were indifferent. In two days we will finally hit Tokyo, one of my favourite cities in the world. Right now I'm laying in bed, almost done updating today's posts and my eyes are about to close... Almost 80km tomorrow. Onwards to Kanagawa!

And PS: if we haven't replied your messages, it's not because we don't love you but because we're exhausted every night. We're truly thankful for everyone's support and will keep going until we reach our final destination at Hakodate!

DAY 25 of our scooting adventures!

Tokyo to Utsunomiya - 1217km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 12 hours

Weather: 17 degrees c

Mood: Abit nervous about our muscles stiffening up after our 3-day rest but feeling more recovered overall

We left Tokyo in high spirits this morning, firstly because we felt well-rested and secondly because we are on the second half of the journey, yay!!!

We did the best pace ever today at 7.5km per hr including stopping for meals and rests! Our muscles feel alot less fatigued but our joints and ligaments have stiffen up. I daresay the real pains in our bodies have officially begun. The miles are catching up to us! My fingers even feel fatigued from gripping the handle bar.

Tresha's decided to continue the trip by backpack and catch up to us because of her lacerations and injuries. Gordon has decided to keep her company. It's sad to go our separate ways but everyone's journey is different.

So many people we meet in life, some join us at the beginning, others halfway. Some stay for a while, some leave early... no one stays forever, but we make the best of the times we have and when we look back one day, we'd realise that we became rich in spirit

DAY 26 of our scooting adventures!

Utsunomiya to Koriyama - 1333km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 15 hours

Weather: 14 degrees c, sunny!

Mood: Feel really exhausted from yesterday's pace. Arch of our soles in alot of pain.

Exhaustion has taken its toll on us. We sat lost somewhere on the roadside, catching our breath. On journeys like these, there's always an infernal desire to push until you reach your goal, but the initiated knows that idealism cannot exist on such arduous undertakings. Reality is a humbling experience for the arrogant. We ended up taking the train halfway on this section of the trip. This train ride was the very first one done out of tiredness and fatigue. In many ways, this seemingly simple decision to take the train was a very confronting experience that required alot of courage to acknowledge and to sit with.

For me personally, it is a reflection of my relationship with failure. Many people have told me that we have done well and that a small train ride doesn't define the failure of the trip as a whole, but for me, that short train ride represented not just my physical inability to 'tahan' through, but also the acknowledgement that I didn't plan well, among other things. In this fight for perfection, I also realise that it is a never-ending bandaid for a deeper pain, one that can only be healed with acceptance.

With acceptance comes stillness and that's when clarity appears. Imperfection is a core nature of the human being and failure, a part of what it takes to be successful. In embracing and acknowledging failure, I make space for future success. I'm starting to understand the phrase, 'it's the journey not the goal', in a different light now.

This was what we started with at the beginning of the trip. You won't believe the amount of things we threw away as we went along hahaha! We go through life thinking we absolutely need certain 'essential' things but we come to realise that half of what we think we need, we can actually survive without. In the end, we take nothing to our grave but our birthday suit. All that matters is a life well lived, in honesty and in love.

DAY 27 of our scooting adventures!

Koriyama to Motomiya - 1347 / 1800km

Can't go by Motomiya without stopping by and spending an evening with my Fukushima family

Can't scoot by Motomiya without spending time with my Fukushima family. What Fukushima means to me has changed over the years. Yet it is not the city that has changed. It is where I have come on my journey of life.

We had another lovely dinner prepared by okasan, my Fukushima mom. She always worries about not preparing a feast but her simple dinners are full of wholesomeness for our body, heart and soul

Always thankful for the loving hearth and warm embrace of my Fukushima family

DAY 28 of our scooting adventures!

Mt Adatara - 1347km / 1800km

Spending the day resting at a cabin sponsored by the wonderful people at Forest Park Adatara!

Mt Bandai is an active volcano located in Fukushima Prefecture Japan, with a height of 1819m. Behind the mountain lies the city of Fukushima.

Two years ago I accidentally stumbled upon this glamping sanctuary on my solo roadtrip to Japan. I got the guys in my office to randomly pick a campsite to surprise me and I drove to where the GPS directed without questioning what it was going to be like. Having camped in many places across the globe, I was more than ready for whatever conditions would appear, even toilet or not, but I wasn't expecting this.

Two years later, I'm back again at this luxurious glampsite, where the campsites are carefully demarcated with pretty stones, the park thoughtfully manicured in a wild way and the cabin cozily snugged amidst the forest floors. There's even an unexpectedly beautiful onsen with an outdoor bath area.

Yet physical beauty isn't just the only thing it offered. I made some wonderful connections with the people at the park. A certain Teddy bear, a fuzzy eyebrow guy, a big smiley bear among many others and of course a very special person who has come to be my dear friend, Emi.

They say places only have meaning when attached to people and memories and Fukushima is that one special place for me. The place where I rested and recuperated my weary soul. Today it became a place where I rest and recuperate my weary feet and body. Just like that, I am ready to be on my way again.

Thanks to everyone who sponsored our night's stay at this beautiful cabin!!! What an apt analogy... a cabin in the mountains for travellers to rest their tired bodies and be on their way... except I know that I'll always be back!

DAY 29 of our scooting adventures!

Mt Adatara to Fukushima - 1374 / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 4 hours

Weather: 17 degrees c, sunny!

Mood: Ditching our trusty Route 4 and looking forward to the lovely ride through the mountains today!

We woke up bleary-eyed, having doused ourselves the night before with horse sashimi, yummy beef and a bottle of wine. Feeling like we had to forcefully pluck ourselves out of our cozy futons, we reluctantly packed our bags and made our way to the checkout. Something about this place compels me to want to rest, over the excitement of continuing my trip.

At the reception, we had a warm farewell from everyone! Our scooters got much curious attention but we received even more warmth and regard with each person we bid farewell to. After a couple of hugs, thoughtful presents among them heat packs from Emi and many "ki o tsuketes" later, meaning "take care and be safe", we were on our way down the mountains to Fukushima.

Today was the first time we ditched the main national highways, the one here called "yon go sen" , and enjoyed a nice scoot through the mountain roads. Along the way, we met even more wonderful people who offered to let us stay at their house and more. Many also waved at us along the roads!

It's the little things that cheer us on to move forwards to see what's over the next hill. It might only be a smile here and a wave there but on big journeys like this, the little cheer goes a long way. Sometimes when we are so focused on the goal, we lose sight and appreciation of what's happening right now. In the end, a mindset and nothing more. These little things help us get over the next hill and I'm choosing Gratitude.

25 Apr

DAY 30 of our scooting adventures!

Fukushima to Odawara - 1417km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 6 hours

Weather: 22 degrees c!

Mood: Feeling good and rested!

And wow, today we just realised that after 30 days of being on the road, we have only met nice people! Not a single bad soul! No one who's been rude, aggressive, nasty... In fact, people have been understanding and even supportive when we might have been an annoyance to road drivers as we sometimes share small roads.

One of the days when heading from Koriyama to Motomiya, we even had the police quietly hold up traffic for 5 minutes while we navigated a small road up the slope. All the while Michelle was oblivious to it and had such an embarrassment when she realised that almost 20 cars were behind her!

Today's trip was one of the most pleasant ones we've had so far! It wasn't just the roads that were well-maintained and smooth, the people were so friendly and generous! Some bought us energy drinks, others Vitamin C sweets and many waved at us from their car!

I say it again, maybe it's just a wave but that flash of smile that comes with it is warmer than even the warmest sunshine. When it gets cold as it sometimes does here, these little warm moments are what keeps us going!

DAY 31 of our scooting adventures!

Ogawara to Sendai - 1451km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 3 hours

Weather: 17 degrees c!

Mood: Can't wait to meet my Sendai family!

If you know me well, you would know that I'm a massive introvert who enjoys quiet spaces and a lot of alone time. I feel more centered and calm, less tired and more at peace. Away from the hustle and bustle of busy Singapore, I love spending my time, not chasing after famous tourist sites, but simply hiding in a mountain cabin, camping in the wilderness or going for a walk in the woods.

Today's trip from Ogawara to Sendai is not entirely a mountainous country like in Adatara, but its semi-countryside feel puts me at immediate ease. I enjoy the Tohoku scenery (aka north of Tokyo for those who don't know) so much more than the cities. There is a certain stillness and warmth to the place, the way countrysides are. I once remarked to Yuki that she's a city girl from Sendai, the biggest city north of Tokyo but she immediately quipped back with a happy smile, "... only to those in Tohoku. To the rest of Japan, Sendai is the countryside."

If Tokyo is the vibrant heart of Japan, its economic lifeblood, then Tohoku is its soul, at once wild and hidden away but present and comfortable with her own identity at the same time. The people it seems, reflect this confidence with natural ease. Today was the day that we were waved at and cheered on by the most number of people I can remember.

We mostly see many shy smiles from people in cars and wide-eyed passerbys, so when someone does approach us, we know it took a small bit of courage on their part to approach these 2 crazy looking foreigners with an equally crazy war banner hanging from their backs

The most touching one was when a guy, also named Yuki (written differently in Japanese), made a u-turn just to stop by the roadside to cheer us on. You know when someone smiles from their heart, you can see it in their eyes. He leaned out over the passenger seat of his car, his arms casually waving and he chatted earnestly. As his way of showing his support and feelings, he gave us a small token of cash and insisted we buy something that will give us a boost. His small act has touched our hearts just as surely as we have touched his.

That day, we received so much love from people, including coffee from an ojisan at 7-11 and of course a home made meal by Yuki's mom! Our trip has been so much more enjoyable because of these little interactions. And all this could only have happened because two strangers have decided to let go of their fears to meet at the side of a random road to see what beautiful experiences would bloom.

DAY 32 of our scooting adventures! Sendai - 1451km / 1800km

We visited the destruction zone of the 2012 tsunami site in Sendai. It was only a 10 minute drive from her house. More details to be written in Facebook or the blog.

I meant to write a detailed one on everything I observed and learnt about the Sendai tsunami but you'll all have to pardon me and give me a couple of days because we're so exhausted by the time we arrive in our hotel. We were initially pushing out 60km - 80km per day at the start of the trip. Now we're lucky if we do 50km. I'm one day behind our updates again but will have time to get up to speed once we hit the major town Morioka.

Day 33 - A fond farewell to Sendai
29 Apr
18194762_400188003688788_5158757698023157767_n.jpg

DAY 33 of our scooting adventures!

Sendai to Osaki - 1491km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 8 hours

Weather: 23 degrees c, warm and sunny!

Mood: Genki, well rested and ready for more!

We woke up at 6.30am this morning to a genki, hearty breakfast prepared by Yuki's momma. Both momma and papa had to go to leave for work early. After a fond farewell to both of them, we left Sendai in happy spirits!

Today felt easy because we rested well. The weather was perfect and we kicked merrily, chatting jovially along the way. Don't be deceived by all our happy posts though because sometimes we become cranky and whingey. But today wasn't one of those days. We had deep conversations about life today, what this trip meant to us, what we hope to achieve when we go back...

Occasionally, we would hear the distant shouts of someone yelling, "ganbatte!", to us. We even had a junior high school girl wishing us good luck and giving us her last pack of Pocky sticks. People everywhere have been very friendly but people around Sendai are not shy to express it! We wonder if this openness is because people in the countryside focus more on the community and also being present to life than city people.

Aside from a beautiful sunset on the bridge where we literally saw the sun drop into the snow-capped mountains, the other highlight was staying in a hotel that initially seemed abandoned. We later found out that that hotel was built to house the workers and builders who worked on rebuilding the destruction of the Sendai tsunami.

If you arrived at the hotel in the evening as we did, you might feel like it's a scene from the game, "Fallout". There was nothing much around in the vincinity. There were wide open areas and an abandoned bowling center and arcade. Do-not-enter ropes were drapped across entrances and dim flashing lights where the light bulbs needed replacement lit up some areas. I swore the hair on my neck stood up. The hotel lobby itself was wide and big but there was no one around except a receptionist. There were three slot machines flashing, their lights casting an eerie glow on the wall as we walked passed. When we spoke, there was also a slight echo. I can't stress enough the vivid images of an apocalyptic disaster wasteland.

When we found out what the hotel was constructed for, it all fell into place. The hotel was built to house the volunteers, builders and construction workers who were working to rebuild the destruction zone after the tsunami aftermath. And there were 5 such spots that have now turned into a hotel. Just that one piece of information changed the whole scene from freaky to humbling, scary to meaningful. From a disaster zone to a purposeful beacon of hope in one small piece of information.

Funny that isn't it? And then it follows that if life is simply a matter of interpretation, then perhaps there are so many more perspectives from which we can potentially view our lives right now.

Day 34 - Allergy attack!
30 Apr
18192379_400402737000648_4561758399554870105_o.jpg
DAY 34 of our scooting adventures!

Osaki to Ichinoseki - 1538km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 8 hours

Weather: 19 degrees c, rains threatened!

Mood: Starting to feel exhausted from allergies

As we go further up north each day, we find that we're both starting to get massive allergies. Yuki's mom reckons it's the cedar pollen that's found in the region. I only know that I sneezed so much that my whole body feels extremely exhausted, as if I ran a marathon on high intensity mode. If you suffer from hay fever like us, you would understand that feeling of exhaustion.

In fact, there were only two times in this whole trip I felt so miserable, I found it hard to find motivation to continue. One of those times was today. Jills, my good friend, asked me the question, "what keeps you going?". I pondered her words carefully as I scooted along today. My motivation was dipping drastically with each sneeze I did and I wondered to myself what the trip meant.

Just like that, the answer came to me. I made a promise to myself more than 10 years ago. At that time, I had never done anything remotely this adventurous before. It was a challenge on so many levels for me. Identifying my boundaries was constantly on my mind as a young pup. Fast forward more than 10 years later, I've even done part of this trip solo before. I understand myself on a much deeper level and I know where my physical, emotional and mental boundaries lie. That's why, this trip isn't so much overcoming the difficulties for me but more the mental determination to see my promise to the end.

And why does this keep me going? Because I truly believe that all good things never come easy. In fact, they are the ones worth fighting for. Fulfilling my promise to myself is a hundred times more important that the discomfort I face. It is easy to run away, but in the act of running away, you deny yourself the beautiful things that you so deserve to have in life. I want to wake up everyday and face the world knowing that I have lived true to myself.

And so I am kicking every mile to the end, no matter the pain, no matter the exhaustion and no matter the allergies, because I deserve to live the good life.

Day 35 - When life throws you yet another curve ball...
1 May
DAY 35 of our scooting adventures! Ichinoseki to Hanamaki - 1592km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 10hours

Weather: 20 degrees c

Mood: Trying to push so we can hit Morioka early and get an extra day of rest.

18238697_401055323602056_6213277017816976258_o.jpg
Look at the love people have shown us along the way Mr and Mrs Terui, who both work in the 7-11 at Kitakami, showered us with their "ganbattes" and more! I returned their love with an invitation to take them sight-seeing by scooters when they come by Singapore, haha!

We left Ichinoseki after a big brekkie at Macdonald's and clocked a mean pace despite the slopes! The lovely hotel receptionist came out to cheer us off but not before trying out our scooters. Her happy smile was enough to warm the cold morning

Everything was progressing smoothly until somewhere along the way, we hit a dirt path and some construction signs. Both sides of the road were closed off. Dang! We stood under the bridge and stared at what felt like one minute at each other. When you're already so tired and then life throws you yet another curve ball...

We were faced with only one choice and one choice alone-to back track at least 5km and lose more than an hour. Times like this stress me out to no end because I am extremely nervous about scooting in the dark. Backtracking 5km equals exactly that. So... entrepreneur's rule 101, when faced with an unavoidable problem, what do you do? You think of a creative solution. We whipped out the drone out for a reconnaissance scouting mission!

I have been asked many questions by family, friends and people along the way. One of them was how I deal with the stress of the unknown aka things going potentially wrong. Just this morning, the receptionist asked where we were heading. We both looked at her cluelessly and said with a grin that we hadn't decided. This response usually leads to astonished looks. It has happened oh-so-very often I have almost memorised the way their eyes pop open and their mouth does an "Ooo" shape

Yet it doesn't mean that I'm not afraid. In fact many times, I feel that same sense of nervousness and uncertainty rise within me, for example, when we found out we couldn't move forwards at the construction site. Perhaps the only small difference I can think of, is the willingness to lean into discomfort. Through years of conscious practise, I set aside immediate comfort for future gain. In that acknowledgement, I opened up, the opportunity to choose and respond to situations rather than react to them.

And little by little, through all that practise and training since I was young, it has given me the confidence that when life throws me another curve ball, I can handle it.

And so that construction obstacle, guess what happened? We found a way out of course, through a little forest dirt track. We had to lug our scooters about 1km but that was better than backtracking 5km.

Life always finds a way if we let it

Day 36 - Going slow and being present
2 May

DAY 36 of our scooting adventures!

Hanamaki to Morioka - 1635km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 4 hours

Weather: 14 degrees c

Mood: Excited to hit the next big town Morioka!

Hanamaki to Morioka was one of the easiest days we've ever done. It was a straight path along our trusty Route 4. On adventure trips like this, a straight path with no obstacles is a luxury to the max!

We were clocking our best pace ever, more than 10km/hr. At twice our previous pace in Western Honshu, we had alot of free time to stop and take photos, chat with people, chill in a cafe with coffee.

A wave from a construction worker standing on top of the roof, a honk from many motorbikers and a friendly cheer from the MOS burger staff... it was a relaxing and "raku" day. I even exchanged my scooter for a guy's bike and we rode along side by side for a kilometre or two, haha!

As I pondered about it all while scooting, it occurred to me how much we have been pushing to reach our goal and how little time we've had to actually fully enjoy the experience. Had we given it more time, how would our experiences have changed? I wondered how our friendship would have developed if we stayed the night at Kyoko's place or accepted someone's offer for coffee or rode for longer than a kilometre or two on someone else's bike. Would we have had many more such spontaneous moments if we gave ourselves more time?

One thing is for sure, if we were to plan this trip again, we would allocate a longer time to stay in more places and connect with more people. The goal is fundamentally essential because it gives us a direction but through this trip, it has become more clear than ever how important it is not to lose sight of the present and to enjoy the journey.

That's why we're taking today slow to give us the time and space to be present and show appreciation to the beauty that's around us.

Day 37 - The beginning of the last hard leg

18216893_401819820192273_998167344317264098_o.jpg
DAY 37 of our scooting adventures!

Morioka to Ninohe - 1709km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 10 hours

Weather: 23 degrees c

Mood: Hot and tired from all the slopes. About 90% of the way is slopes!

We've generally had it easy the whole trip when it came to terrain. North of Morioka is where the fun stuff begins. From here onwards, it's mountainous all the way up to Aomori. If Aomori is known as the gateway to Hokkaido, then north of Morioka is known as the gateway to torture for scooters.

If you've traversed the land of the rising sun, you would know how hilly it is. But nowhere in Japan is as mountainous as where we are. Settlements are built on all the flat land that exists. The main routes, such as our trusty Route 4, hugs the valley floor between mountains. It runs flat for miles and miles on end until it can run flat no longer. And today was the day we came face to face with our nemesis.

The roads soon started becoming windy and narrow. We passed through what felt like 3 mountain passes. If you think that sounds tame, wait until you try to scoot up a steep slope for 5km and repeat that up and down 3 times. Some parts were so narrow there were no sidewalks and we literally scooted on the road itself. While we weren't in any immediate danger, it kept us on high alert the whole day, tension and stress rising to the max. This is on top of the physical exertion of scooting up hills. At this point I reflected on my answer to Jills about what keeps me going.

It's simple. All good things come with hard work. There is no shortcut to success. There is an immense satisfaction that comes with identifying our boundaries. When we know where our borders lie, physically, emotionally and mentally, we become one step closer to accepting ourselves for who we are. All the "what-ifs" get blown away by the wind and the regrets melt away like snow. There is no questioning who you are because you already know your limits. And the only way to get here, is through honest-to-goodness hard work.

And that's why we kick the miles everyday so that when we wake up tomorrow, we will wake with happiness and peace on our face, knowing that we have given our very best.

Day 38 - The steep ascent into the Hakoda mountain ranges

18238489_402705843437004_7557641248506381921_o.jpg
DAY 38 of our scooting adventures!

Ninohe to Towada - 1759km / 1800km

Estimated scooting time: 8 hours

Weather: 26 degrees c

Mood: It felt like a furnace. We were nervous about crossing the next 3 mountain passes, many parts without a side walk, and apprehensive about the physical exertion. We made it eventually but got sunburnt

Day 37 marked our entry into the hilly terrain of the Aomori region. Out of the total of 70km+, there would have been about 15km of ascending slopes. Day 38 on the other hand, marked our real steep ascent into the mountains, as we scoot deeper into the Hakoda ranges through the multiple mountain passes. Out of the 50km+, about nearly three-quarters of it were ascending slopes, some of them without sidewalks once again.

In our tiredness, we would sometimes hop off our scooters and walk up instead. Other times we stubbornly try to scoot up, going against all muscle fatigue. Once we even stopped right at the roadside curb to eat in sun because there was nowhere else. As the towns get sparser, the region more hilly, we also noticed there are lesser convenience stores around too. Those "conbini" that have been our lifeblood throughout this trip have become increasingly harder to find. So we try to stock up on as much as we can just in case. I ended up having my whole backpack full of snacks from fear and desperation!

This trip was by far, one of the most challenging leg on so many levels. Physically, it had the most distance in ascent. Emotionally, there was doubt and fear on whether we would make it and if we did could we do it before nightfall. Mentally, there was no failsafe to rely on because there simply was no backup plan. Public transport was zero along the passes. You can imagine the tension that was present early this morning. Neither of us had crossed this many mountain passes without sidewalks on a scooter before.

Yet on a journey like this, such issues have to be confronted everyday whether we like it or not. And they have to be confronted at point blank to move forwards. During times like these, there is a natural response to focus on our fears and other negatives, like "what ifs" because they protect us from potential harm and keep us safe. And yet in that safe refuge, we peer outside hungrily wondering what's out there. The desire to be an adventurer is strong and curious in all of us. The fear of the unknown is perhaps also equally strong.

How do you manage the fight between the two then? The answer is simple. You don't.

If we sit back and take a deep breath, we come to realise that oftentimes it's not so much the practical and logical aspects of things that we are afraid of as it is the emotions that are running rampant in us. Our decisions end up being driven by what seems to be practical and logical justifications but are actually underlaid by fear and stress.

Embracing our natural response to uncertainty and discomfort is perhaps the first step towards building confidence within ourselves. The way Michael handles uncertainy is by using plain logic and mathematical probabilities. The way I deal with uncertainty is through sheer confidence from having had my boundaries constantly pushed my whole life.

Through pushing my boundaries, I learn to identify what I'm comfortable taking on physically, emotionally and mentally. This simple identification gives me my identity. It helps me know who I am, what I want and how far I'm willing to go for what I want. When we begin to operate from a space of ownership, we feel empowered to make choices that serve us, instead of feeling cornered to make a decision out of fear. One simple change in mindset and a rainbow of colours appear on the horizon.

And what's the best way to kickstart this journey? By being present to what you feel and then doing the hard work of leaning into the discomfort.

There definitely was one thing we got out of leaning into today's discomfort: the confidence of knowing that if those similar mountain passes appear on the road ahead, whether in Japan or some other country, we will be able to handle them somehow!

And that is why we will continue leaning into the challenges that tomorrow will surely throw at us.

Day 39 - Golden week holiday madness
6 May
18319022_403049573402631_1839015657084013177_o (1).jpg
DAY 39 of our scooting adventures!
Towada - 1759km / 1842km
A quick update to keep everyone in the loop!

The final distance will be 1842km because we are bypassing the direct mountain path to scoot along the coast.

We're currently stuck in Towada because of the rains. The rain front will pass this evening so we will begin our last major day of scooting tomorrow. Cloudy skies forecasted but no rain, phew!

After that, it will be a 3 hr ferry across to Hakodate, and then a short 10km hike up Mt Hakodate!

We expect to summit on Monday late afternoon between 4-6pm! Stay tuned! We're nearly there!

Have you heard of the Japanese golden week holidays? It is a long stretch of public holidays beginning on the end of April and lasts until early May. In a culture where long holidays are not a perogative of employees, Golden week is a holy period for all! Almost everyone takes the whole week off to travel, making it a really challenging and expensive time for tourists. Flights, hotels and car rentals are usually booked months in advance to secure a spot.

Without really realising it, we're once again scooting during a busy period. If you know us well, you'd know that we never book more than a few days in advance of anything. This time though, we've stretched our limits of risk-taking to the max by booking only when we arrive. In many ways, we've decided to do that because we could never really be sure where we'll be at the end of each day. So we learned to get comfortable rocking up to hotels when we arrive; two tired and haggard foreigners with scooters and war banners asking in broken Japanese, "Erm, I don't have a reservation but I would like a room." If that's already deemed crazy, you can guess what people's response were when we said we haven't planned for Golden week.

As usual, we did fine and even managed to get a room only after asking one other hotel, yay! The "onsen" or hot springs were packed like sardines with people and we had to take a queue number for the free breakfast buffet. The carpark was also full to the last lot. This was on the Friday night. Come Saturday morning which is the end of the Golden week celebrations, the place emptied out instantly and felt like an abandoned hotel in the middle of a ghost town.

It got us discussing about the reasons why Japanese don't take long holidays and try to pack most of their holidays into Golden week. According to many friends I've asked, there seems to be a sense of responsibility to the company and to their colleagues. It is uncommon to take leave for anything more than a few days. One week is apparently stretching it. But taking Golden week off is fine.

We wonder if the reason why it's okay is because everyone is taking it at the same time. Expectations are set, business can plan accordingly for it and no one is letting anyone down. Perhaps the attitude towards the Golden week holiday is a reflection of a deeper cultural sense of responsibility that is prevalent in Japan.

Then the real question to ask is, where is this strong sense of responsibility stemming from? Perhaps to really understand any culture, we need to remain curious and open to look beyond what's obvious.

18278342_403521066688815_6824916594354222276_o.jpg
DAY 40 of our scooting adventures!

Towada to Aomori - 1829km / 1842km

Estimated scooting time: 12 hours

Weather: 16 degrees c, wind is 47km/hr

Mood: Nervous about our last leg! Some slopes but we're taking the coastal path after Noheji to avoid the ranges. Headwinds are over 40km/hr

Today's marks the last major scoot and also the hardest day of our trip! Our nervousness was nothing compared to the force of the headwinds! Average wind speed recorded today in the city was 47km/hour. I daresay it was way higher than that along the coastline.

This crazy winds lasted for more than half our journey. When we decided to take the coastal route, we swore it would be much better than the mountain ranges. Now we're questioning if that was the right choice.

As we battled what should be more correctly termed head gales, instead of headwinds, there was also a certain sense of satisfaction that our last major day of scooting wasn't a walk in the park. You know that really awesome feeling of finally getting something that you've worked hard for? That feeling of satisfaction only ever comes when a real challenge is overcome or when things are not easy to get. It really felt like the Wind Gods were trying to stop us in our tracks!

I recall Eric said something similar, "You know what? It's like on video games, the final boss must be the hardest to beat so that you are so proud when you finish the game!" And so it was, today felt like the final boss of a computer game.

And you know what? We beat it!

---

PS: Tomorrow will be our last day! It's a 3 hr ferry ride from Aomori city to Hakodate and then a 10km scoot up the moutain! We expect to summit between 4-6pm JP time!

Mission complete! We made it!!!
8 May
18275217_404101839964071_5284962871454943768_n.jpg
And we made it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mission complete! We made it!!!

At the moment of ascent, we stood in stunned silence for more than a couple of moments, unsure of what to feel. Our mantra everyday since the 41 days ago, was to just "kick one step further". Now that we've reached the last kick, it took a while to tell ourselves we didn't need to kick anymore. For those who have done a long distance race before and know the feeling of relief when you reach the end, this feels somewhat different. We had already pushed ourselves way beyond what we initially perceived as "the end" such that when we came to the real end, there was a moment of stark uncertainty.

We picked up our scooters and climbed to the top of the observatory and took our queue with a lovely old couple. After all Chinese tourists were done, it was our turn to plant our Singapore tourist footprint. As it has always been on the whole trip, I'm usually the one chirping away with all the strangers that we meet, in my smattering of broken Japanese, interspersed with English and hand signs. From strangers to friends, one chirp at a time. But somehow at that moment, I was too shell shocked that it has ended to chirp away to anyone.

Then it happened.

A nod from the old lady. An offer of help to take the photo for us from the old man. Some small talk. Then the chirps started to flow out. We took pictures together and excitedly shared what we did, how far we've come from. Those words, "hehhhhh, Fukuoka kara?!", wow, from Fukuoka?!, with that expellation of breathe, I have also come to memorise on this trip. She spoke briefly about where she lived. He mentioned that he's retired and enjoying the city life in Tokyo. She had a distant look as if she was reflecting on something.

And as I stood there chirping away with the lovely couple, it reminded me truly of what this trip was about. For me, this trip was about connecting with people, sharing our stories, our hopes and dreams, joys and regret and exchanging a small piece of our hearts with each other. In that moment it dawned on me, it wasn't the goal that was important, it was something else.

Each of these special moments and pieces of hearts that we have exchanged - a genuine smile, nods from car windows, maniac waves across the sidewalks, frequent shouts of "ganbatte", sometimes heartfelt tears of joys and connection - has made my life more meaningful than it was each moment before.

And right at that very second when I told her that she was the first person on the mountain that I'm telling, I saw the tears across the old lady's face, and knew that another piece of heart had been exchanged. And so with sudden clarity, I realised that this journey I have embarked on hasn't really ended with the summit.

The journey will continue for as long as we are all sharing pieces of our hearts with each other.

And through that we all live on in each other hearts...

---

Will be posting 3 more updates in the next few days:

1. A thank you video for everyone who has supported us

2. An equipment update and review video

3. A breakdown on the details of the journey, eg: trip costs, terrain, weight lost (if any lols), etc etc

Post from this evening -> So much to happiness, satisfaction and joy to share with everyone! We're having dinner now and then going for the night view! So hang in there for our final drone shots of the mountain later tonight. Meanwhile enjoy the photo we took when we ascended!

Thank you :)

When we came on this trip, we had a rough idea in our minds how it would be like. One thing that was a really pleasant surprise, was the warmth and friendliness of the people we met along the way. That's why this trip cannot be complete without this video, a little tribute to remember all the beautiful souls that we met.

That's why this trip cannot be complete without this video, a little tribute to remember all the beautiful souls that we met.

People have told us that the way we choose to live our lives has touched them. But you know what? We feel humbled by this experience. We didn't expect to be shown so much genuine love, joy and happiness people by everyone. Your courage and openness in reaching out to us has made our experience so much meaningful and rewarding. Your smiles, cheers and hugs have given us strength when we felt like giving up. Because you guys were there, it gave us energy, purpose and motivation to kick one more kick!

Thank you everyone for all the cheers and shouts of ganbatte along the road side, the warmth and genuine excitement of everyone we chatted with, all the lovely gifts of support: drinks, food and green tea, coffee, snacks, Polky sticks and mochi. We even exchanged our scooters and bicycles with each other.

You have touched our lives in more ways than you can imagine, that's why, we will remember this trip not just by the miles that have passed but by the people who have come into our lives. So thank you for being a part of our journey and perhaps one day, we can be a part of yours too!

今回の旅に際し期待以上に嬉しかった事は旅の先々で出会った皆さんの暖かい友情でした。この思い出を忘れない為にもこのビデオを作りました。私達が出会った美しい方々へのわずかばかりの贈り物です。

旅先で出会った皆さんは私達が選んだ生き方に感動した、と言って下さいました。しかし私達こそ皆さんが与えて下さった真の愛情や喜び、幸せに頭の下がる思いです。皆さんの勇気や私達に対する呼びかけにより私達の経験は一層意味深い、そして報いの大きいものになりました。皆さんの笑顔や声援は私達に勇気を下さり、諦めそうになった時には前に進む力をくれました。皆さんがいて下さったからこそ、私達はキックし続けるエネルギーと目的そしてモチベーションを得られたのです。

皆さん、本当に熱い声援、「頑張って！」の掛け声を有難うございました。お話し出来た方々が私達に示して下さった興味、数々の素敵なプレゼント、エネルギー補助食品、コーヒー、お茶、お菓子や食品、それにスクーターと自転車の交換など本当に有難うございました。

皆さんの事は皆さんが思っていらっしゃる以上に私達の心に深く刻まれました。私達はこの旅を旅した距離ではなく、出会った方々との思い出として思い出す事でしょう。私達の旅の一部となって下さり本当に有難うございました。いつか私達が皆さんの旅の一部になれますように！
